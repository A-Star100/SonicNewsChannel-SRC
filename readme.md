# Hey there! Welcome to Sonic Channel's Git repo!

The following repository consists of **decompiled versions** of the Sonic Channel source code.
The app was made in a no-code environment (MIT App Inventor). But that doesn't mean I can't **decompile the APK and save it in git!**

Remember that the **original APKs for all versions are available [here](https://sites.google.com/view/sonicnews-snc/other-ways-to-experience-our-website/sonic-channel-app-download), but the decompiled versions are all in GitHub :)**.

Sonic Channel is a now-discontinued source of Sonic news. **Our mobile app is the main highlight of this repo, as it contains decompiled versions of every release.** If you're interested in getting the compiled versions, go [here](https://sites.google.com/view/sonicnews-snc/archive/welcome-to-the-archive). If you want to compile from source yourself (and/or make a custom version), go ahead! Try to add some originality if you're making a custom version, though.

**Sonic Channel and its app is discontinued. Do NOT expect updates of any sort for the website or the app.** **Sorry, iOS users! You can view how to run the app on iOS [here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fgwrqEuuWo6Kuv1NomYp334UXKJdI82XCsFaRmh5X6o/edit?usp=sharing)**
