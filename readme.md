# Hey there! Welcome to Sonic Channel's Git repo!

The following repository consists of **decompiled versions** of the Sonic Channel source code.
The app was made in a no-code environment. But that doesn't mean I can't **decompile the APK and save it in git!**

Remember that the **original APKs for all versions are available to the public, but the decompiled version is in GitHub :)**.
