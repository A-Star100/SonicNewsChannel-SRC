# Sonic News Channel
This is an old, discontinued project of mine. It's been discontinued for almost a year now, it no longer recieves updates.

It was intended to give you the latest and greatest Sonic news, however due to personal issues (and how much effort maintaining a news website takes), it is now discontinued. However,
because the apps all use a WebView, this means I can simply update the website and everything will be un-discontinued.

But there's really no benefit to updating this project anymore. The **Ultimate** version was the last hurrah for this now-discontinued project. It will no longer be maintained, and now remains a public archive.

The mobile website (used for the legacy mobile app), is [here](https://sites.google.com/view/snc-mobile/home).

## Legacy app
The legacy app was built with MIT App Inventor. Its WebViewer is inefficient and uses legacy APIs, and less efficient caching, so even on a modern smartphone like a Samsung Galaxy S21,
the web browser lagged, so a mobile version of the site needed to be created.

## Ultimate app
The ultimate app was built with Kodular, as an effort to start over on a new leaf. It included new features and a better UI. Kodular's WebViewer is more efficient but I've stuck with App
Inventor or frameworks like Flutter for building my Android apps because they tend to be more lightweight and easier to use on both ends (however some Flutter packages are inefficient).

However, this project was the first ever app I created without any curriculums or anything, independently. This small project paved the road for bigger projects of mine, like [SimpliPlay](https://simpliplay.netlify.app), and [MovieServer](https://aboutmovieserver.netlify.app), and was what fueled my creativity. Ever since I joined GitHub, my tech adventures have grown bigger and bigger. But it's nice to go back to simplicity sometimes.
