**How to run Sonic Channel on iOS**

1\. Download the AIA file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xNX-JPiZM-tdTlwKHlZntAbgjGJIeCK/view?usp=sharing) with all the source code (don't tell it to anyone)

2\. Go [here](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) (click on Create Apps, because then you can login).

3\. Create an account (you can sign in with Google)

4\. Click on Projects in a menu that looks like [this](https://ibb.co/YkVFYvg).

5\. Then click on "Import .aia file from my computer". Upload the AIA file you got there.

6\. Download the MIT App Inventor Companion app on the App Store

7\. If you go [here](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-device-wifi.html) you can figure out how to set up the Companion app with your computer (make sure they are connected to the same internet)

Once you're done with all the steps you should see the app inside the MIT App Inventor Companion app.

(it is a bit trickier than Android though).
