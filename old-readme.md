# Sonic News Channel on GitHub

The following repository consists of **decompiled versions** of the Sonic News Channel source code.
The app was made in a no-code environment (MIT App Inventor and Kodular). But that doesn't mean I can't **decompile the APKs and save it in git!**

Remember that the original APKs for all versions are available [here](https://sites.google.com/view/sonicnews-snc/other-ways-to-experience-our-website/sonic-channel-app-download), but the decompiled versions (at least for the legacy app) are all in GitHub :).

Sonic Channel is a now-discontinued source of Sonic news. **Our mobile app is the main highlight of this repo, as it contains decompiled versions of every release.** If you're interested in getting the compiled versions, go [here](https://sites.google.com/view/sonicnews-snc/archive/welcome-to-the-archive). If you want to compile from source yourself (and/or make a custom version), go ahead! Try to add some originality if you're making a custom version, though.

**Sonic News Channel and its app is discontinued (although I made one last version of the app in Kodular, much better than all the others, but) Do NOT expect future updates of any sort for the website (one last update) or the app.** **Sorry, iOS users! You can view how to run the app on iOS [here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fgwrqEuuWo6Kuv1NomYp334UXKJdI82XCsFaRmh5X6o/edit?usp=sharing)**

**:D**

## Info
From now on, **GitHub Releases** will be the way to get all new versions of the app, starting from version 1.2 (probably the last version) of Sonic News Channel Ultimate.
Anyway, hope you enjoy!
