**GitHub Repository**

**Why GitHub?**  
GitHub is easily accessible, more popular, and is better than GitLab in my opinion, as GitLab is more enterprise-optimized, whereas GitHub is free, but like GitLab they offer paid plans as well. But GitHub’s paid plans start at just $4, unlike GitLab, with a starting point of $29, meaning that you have to be dedicated to GitLab if you want to go forward with a big payment like that.

**Why a repository?**  
You see, storing source code on Google Drive isn’t exactly great for a number of reasons:

1. No intuitive collab features. GitHub includes many features that allow users to instantly edit source code, and collaborate to improve the project. The technology used for GitHub and GitLab, Git, contains servers and many more capabilities hidden inside. And it is so powerful, even Google uses it to backup their data every once in a while. Since it has servers separate from your local workspace, you can both backup your project in case something goes wrong and intuitively manage and edit source code, all in one place.  
1. Storage limits. Don’t forget that GitHub and GitLab, which are basically just Git viewers with nice UI and added features, have storage limits too. But even in the free tier, you do get a substantial amount of storage. About 15 GB, just like Google. But plans to increase that amount are miles cheaper than the same offered from Google. And don’t forget about all the intuitive features Git has that can’t be done in GDrive. And you can’t modify the files stored in Google’s servers, unlike GitHub and GitLab, which both allow you to code efficiently in your browser, with no software needed, at all. You just use the Command Line/Terminal to upload hoards of files easily.

   In general, Google just doesn’t offer an intuitive workspace in your browser, they offer it with software, which can be confusing to install, especially if you’re not tech-savvy.
